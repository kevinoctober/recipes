    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a classic Brittish dish that serves 6 people. It reminds you of winters by the fire.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 large potatoes</li>
        <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
        <li>2 large handfuls of baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>250 ml double cream</li>
        <li>mature Cheddar or Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 heaped teaspoon English mustard</li>
        <li>1 large handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>450 g haddock , or cod fillet, skin off, pin-boned, from sustainable sources</li>
        <li>1 whole nutmeg , for grating (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 230°C/450°F/gas 8.</li>
        <li>Peel and dice the potatoes into 2.5cm chunks, then put into boiling salted water and bring back to the boil for 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Carefully add the eggs to the pan and cook for a further 8 minutes, or until hard-boiled, by which time the potatoes should also be cooked. </li>
        <li>At the same time, steam the spinach in a colander above the pan. This will only take a minute. When the spinach is done, remove from the colander and gently squeeze out any excess moisture. </li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes in the colander. Remove the eggs, cool under cold water, then peel and quarter them. Place to one side.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the onion, then peel, halve and finely chop the carrot. </li>
        <li>In a separate pan, slowly fry the onion and carrot in a little oil for about 5 minutes, then add the double cream and bring just to the boil.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and finely grate in 2 good handfuls of cheese, then squeeze in the lemon juice and stir through the mustard.</li>
        <li>Pick and finely chop the parsley and stir into the cream mixture. </li>
        <li>Slice the fish into strips then place in an earthenware dish with the spinach and eggs and mix together, pouring over the creamy vegetable sauce. </li>
        <li>The cooked potatoes should be drained and mashed – add a bit of oil, sea salt, black pepper and a touch of nutmeg (if using). Spread on top of the fish. Don’t bother piping it to make it look pretty – it’s a homely hearty thing.</li>
        <li>Place in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden. </li>
        <li>Serve with some nice peas or greens, not forgetting your baked beans and tomato ketchup. Tacky but tasty, and that’s what I like.</li>
