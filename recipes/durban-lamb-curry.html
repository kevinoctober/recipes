        <li>Curry Leaves</li>
        <li>Jam tomatoes (3 large)</li>

        <li>Water, if required.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A few hours before cooking, coat your lamb pieces with curry powder / masala</li>
        <li>On a medium head, add oil to pot</li>
        <li>Gently braise your curry powder coated lamb pieces – and set aside. (retain as much oil and meat juices in the pot as possible. Pour any juices from the bowl into which you set your pieces aside, back into your pot.</li>
        <li>Add cinnamon, turmeric, jerra powder (cumin), dhania powder, fennel powder, fenugreek powder, mustard seeds &amp; split chillies</li>
        <li>Allow your spices to fry a bit in the oil (Do not let them burn)</li>
        <li>Add grated onions, saute until soft</li>
        <li>Add garlic &amp; ginger, saute until fragrant</li>
        <li>Add grated tomatoes, cook until tomatoes are have “melted”</li>
        <li>Add Curry Powder / Masala. (allow to fry, but do not allow to burn)</li>
        <li>Add Lamb pieces, mix into sauce and gently saute</li>
        <li>Add water if desired (I add a cup or 2 and let it cook down)</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat to a gentle simmer and cook until the lamb pieces are soft (I set timer for 20 mins and then check)</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste</li>
        <li>Add potatoes</li>
        <li>Cook until potatoes are soft. (Turn up the heat if you want to cook off liquid, but do not allow the sauce to burn on the bottom of the pot)</li>
        <li>Serve with rice, roti, as a Bunny Chow, on slices of thick buttered bread or even as our friends in the UK do … over a portion of chips.</li>
    </ol>
